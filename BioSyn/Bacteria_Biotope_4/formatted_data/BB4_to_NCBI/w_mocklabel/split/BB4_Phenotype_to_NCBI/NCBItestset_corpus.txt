24794620-002|a|Bacterial OTUs belonged to four different phyla. Most OTUs were affiliated to genera often found in cheese, including high numbers of coryneforms. The most abundant OTU from 16S rRNA gene libraries showed highest similarity to Halomonas. Young cheese rinds were dominated by Actinobacteria or Proteobacteria, particularly by Halomonas and Brevibacterium aurantiacum, while Staphyloccocus equorum was most abundant in old cheeses. The most abundant 18S rRNA OTU had highest similarity to the filamentous fungus Scopulariopsis brevicaulis. Pairwise correlation analyses revealed putative co-occurrences between a number of OTUs.

11548252|t|[Analysis of toxin genetic determinants of Vibrio cholerae virulence cassette and neuraminidase with DNA probes].
11548252|a|V. cholerae strains of different origin have been studied for the presence of cholera toxin genes (vct), the proximal part of the virulence cassette including genes zot, ace and orfU, as well as neuraminidase genes (neu), in their genomes with the use of molecular DNA probes. The possibility, in principle, for some strains to lose only a part of their virulence cassette (gene vct), while retaining its proximal part has been shown. In most cases such strains are isolated from patients with diarrhea of different severity and may probably play some etiological role, provided that the expression of the genes of additional toxins of the virulence cassette occurs. The gene expressing neuraminidase which facilitates the penetration of cholera toxin into the epithelial cells of the intestine is always present in vct+ strains and may be absent in vct- strains. The absence of genetic relationship between neuraminidases in V. cholerae O139 and V. cholerae O1 and non-O1 (non-O139) has been confirmed. The problems in connection with the integration and deletion of genetic determinants of V. cholerae virulence factors are discussed.

24794620-003|a|At the beginning of the ripening process lactate, produced by lactic acid bacteria, is metabolized by yeasts, primarily Debaryomyces hansenii and Geotrichum candidum, resulting in an increase in the pH of the cheese surface ( Bockelmann et al., 2005, Irlinger and Mounier, 2009 and Montel et al., 2014). These processes and the metabolism of yeast growth factors facilitate the growth of coagulase-negative staphylococci such as Staphylococcus equorum and salt-tolerant bacterial communities – mainly coryneforms – such as Corynebacterium spp., Arthrobacter spp., Micrococcus spp., Brevibacterium spp. and Brachybacterium spp. Finally, bacteria and yeasts cover the entire surface of the cheeses. Coryneform bacteria are particularly abundant in cheese rinds ( Delbes et al., 2007, Gori et al., 2013, Maoz et al., 2003 and Rea et al., 2007). In addition, Gram-negative bacteria such as Halomonas spp., Vibrio spp., and Hafnia alvei have been detected on cheese surfaces ( Brennan et al., 2002, Coton et al., 2012, Feurer et al., 2004a, Gori et al., 2013, Irlinger and Mounier, 2009, Ishikawa et al., 2007, Maoz et al., 2003, Mounier et al., 2005 and Rea et al., 2007).

24794620-012|a|he presence of Staphylococcus equorum and several other species of coagulase-negative staphylococci on the surfaces of long-ripened cheeses has been reported previously ( Gori et al., 2013 and Irlinger et al., 1997). S. equorum may contribute to the aromatic characteristics and the orange pigments of cheeses as a result of the production of extracellular proteolytic and lipolytic enzymes. Staphylococci have been reported to produce antibacterial substances, e.g. S. equorum strain WS 2733 produces a peptide antibiotic (macrococcin P1) on the surface of Raclette cheese, which inhibits the growth of L. monocytogenes ( Carnio et al., 2000). We detected a significant increase of S. equorum (OTU 3) in long-ripened cheese rinds of all facilities as well as in younger cheeses of ripening cellar A1.

12443829|t|Subtyping of Shiga toxin 2 variants in human-derived Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli strains isolated in Japan.
12443829|a|Shiga toxin 2 (Stx2) variants have been found to exhibit not only antigenic divergence, but also differences in toxicity for tissue culture cells and animals. To clarify whether all or just a subset of Stx2 variants are important for the virulence of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli, we designed PCR primers to detect and type all reported variants. We classified them into four groups according to the nucleotide sequences of the Stx2 family; for example, group 1 (G1) contains VT2vha and group 2 (G2) contains VT2d-Ount. The 120 strains of Shiga toxin-producing E. coli used in this study were isolated from humans in Japan between 1986 and 1999. Among the four variant groups, the G1 gene only was detected in 23 of the 120 clinical strains (19.2%) and all belonged to the O157 serotype. G1 is considered the most important Stx2 variant group in terms of human pathogenicity. A multiplex PCR that can detect the stx1, stx2, and G1 genes was developed as a means of rapid and easy typing to better understand the roles of the different types of Stx.

19526548|t|Insight into the core and variant exoproteomes of Listeria monocytogenes species by comparative subproteomic analysis.
19526548|a|While Listeria monocytogenes is responsible for listeriosis, it is also a saprophytic species with exceptional survival aptitudes. Secreted proteins are one of the main tools used by bacteria to interact with their environment. In order to take into account the biodiversity of L. monocytogenes species, exoproteomic analysis was carried out on 12 representative strains. Following 2-DE and MALDI-TOF MS, a total of 151 spots were identified and corresponded to 60 non-orthologous proteins. To categorize and analyze these proteomic data, a rational bioinformatic approach predicting final subcellular localization was carried out. Fifty-two out of the 60 proteins identified (86.7%) were indeed predicted as localized in the extracellular milieu (gene ontology (GO): 0005576). Most of them (65.4%) were actually predicted as secreted via the Sec translocon. Comparative analysis allowed for proteins found in all or only in a subset of L. monocytogenes strains to be defined. While the core exoproteome included most proteins related to bacterial virulence, cell wall biogenesis, as well as proteins secreted by unknown pathways, a slight variation in the protein members of these categories were observed and constituted the variant exoproteome. This investigation resulted in the first definition of the core and variant exoproteomes of L. monocytogenes where corollaries on bacterial physiology are further discussed.

11395453|t|Signaling system in Porphyromonas gingivalis based on a LuxS protein.
11395453|a|The luxS gene of quorum-sensing Vibrio harveyi is required for type 2 autoinducer production. We identified a Porphyromonas gingivalis open reading frame encoding a predicted peptide of 161 aa that shares 29% identity with the amino acid sequence of the LuxS protein of V. harveyi. Conditioned medium from a late-log-phase P. gingivalis culture induced the luciferase operon of V. harveyi, but that from a luxS insertional mutant did not. In P. gingivalis, the expression of luxS mRNA was environmentally controlled and varied according to the cell density and the osmolarity of the culture medium. In addition, differential display PCR showed that the inactivation of P. gingivalis luxS resulted in up-regulation of a hemin acquisition protein and an arginine-specific protease and reduced expression of a hemin-regulated protein, a TonB homologue, and an excinuclease. The data suggest that the luxS gene in P. gingivalis may function to control the expression of genes involved in the acquisition of hemin.

9521139|t|Capsular serotype and antibiotic resistance of Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates in two Chilean cities.
9521139|a|We compared the incidence of nasopharyngeal colonization by Streptococcus pneumoniae, the serotypes causing mucosal and invasive diseases, and the antibiotic resistance of these strains in patients admitted to three large hospitals and children attending day care centers in two Chilean cities (Santiago and Temuco). The populations in both cities were similar in ethnic background, socioeconomic status, family size, and access to medical care. Significant differences in nasopharyngeal colonization rates, in serotypes causing infections, and in antibiotic resistance were found between the two cities. In children 0 to 2 years of age, 42% were colonized with S. pneumoniae in Santiago compared to 14% in Temuco. A total of 41 serotypes were identified in both Chilean cities studied. Six serotypes were found only in Santiago; 14 serotypes were found only in Temuco. Antibiotic-resistant serotypes 6A, 6B, 14, 19F, and 23F were detected only in Santiago. We show that important differences in the incidence of nasopharyngeal carriage, infection, and S. pneumoniae serotypes can exist in similar populations in different areas of the same country. Our findings are relevant for prevention strategies, antibiotic usage, and vaccine design.

24794620-008|a|Similarly to previous studies (Maoz et al., 2003, Mounier et al., 2009 and Quigley et al., 2013), we found Halomonas (OTU1) to be the most frequent OTU in short-ripened cheeses from all facilities (A, B, C). For some time the occurrence of Halomonas in dairy products was a matter for controversial discussion. Halomonas was suggested to be an indicator for hygienic deficiencies in cheese producing facilities ( Maoz et al., 2003), while it has also been suggested that these bacteria, which originally originate in marine environments, are added via sea salt to cheese surfaces during washing and dry salting (Ishikawa et al., 2007). The dominance of Halomonas in short-ripened cheese rinds is most likely due to more frequent washing with a higher brine concentration. The high abundance of Halomonas in VB cheese rinds suggests an important function during cheese ripening, particularly of young cheese. However, it is still unknown whether Halomonas contributes to the flavor or texture of VB or other cheeses.Coryneform bacteria including Brevibacterium spp., Corynebacterium spp., Arthrobacter spp., Microbacterium spp. and Brachybacterium spp. are important for cheese ripening due to their proteolytic activity and because they produce volatile sulfur compounds or ammonia ( Eliskases-Lechner and Ginzinger, 1995). Similarly to other studies ( Dolci et al., 2009, Feurer et al., 2004b, Gori et al., 2013, Maoz et al., 2003, Mounier et al., 2005 and Rea et al., 2007), we found a high diversity and abundance of coryneforms (13 OTUs, 149 out of 408 clones) in VB cheese rinds.B. linens is an important flavor producer and responsible for the development of the typical red pigmentation of red-smear cheeses, which result from the production of a red carotenoid. It has been described as the most common organism on cheese surfaces ( Eliskases-Lechner and Ginzinger, 1995 and Rattray and Fox, 1999).

12563490|t|Acute inflammatory response in the stomach of BALB/c mice challenged with coccoidal Helicobacter pylori.
12563490|a|An experimental murine model was used to verify the viability and pathogenicity of coccoid Helicobacter pylori. For this purpose, 27 BALB/c mice were inoculated intragastrically with 1 ml broth culture (10(8)organisms/ml) of a coccoid H. pylori clinical isolate. The animals were divided into two groups. Nine were infected on a one-time basis (GA1) and 18 were infected on two consecutive days (GA2). Other 27 mice were inoculated with Brucella broth and divided in the same way; they composed the control group. Mice were killed at 2, 3, 7, 14 and 21 days post inoculation (pi). Fragments of stomach and duodenum were collected, fixed with 12% formalin and stained by hematoxilin-eosin and Giemsa for histopathological examination. Until the 14th()day, only reinfected mice had mild-to-moderate inflammatory infiltrate in the stomach. The infiltration was predominantly lymphomonocytic, although plasma cells and eosinophils could be seen. However, at 21st day, severe eosinophilic infiltration was present in the lamina propria and submucosa of gastric corpus. In subgroup GA1, animals presented lymphomonocytic infiltration in the stomach from 14th()day pi. Our results showed that coccoid H. pylori was able to induce an acute inflammatory response in stomach of reinfected mice since the initial periods of infection.

17535798|t|Grazing protozoa and the evolution of the Escherichia coli O157:H7 Shiga toxin-encoding prophage.
17535798|a|Humans play little role in the epidemiology of Escherichia coli O157:H7, a commensal bacterium of cattle. Why then does E. coli O157:H7 code for virulence determinants, like the Shiga toxins (Stxs), responsible for the morbidity and mortality of colonized humans? One possibility is that the virulence of these bacteria to humans is coincidental and these virulence factors evolved for and are maintained for other roles they play in the ecology of these bacteria. Here, we test the hypothesis that the carriage of the Stx-encoding prophage of E. coli O157:H7 increases the rate of survival of E. coli in the presence of grazing protozoa, Tetrahymena pyriformis. In the presence but not the absence of Tetrahymena, the carriage of the Stx-encoding prophage considerably augments the fitness of E. coli K-12 as well as clinical isolates of E. coli O157 by increasing the rate of survival of the bacteria in the food vacuoles of these ciliates. Grazing protozoa in the environment or natural host are likely to play a significant role in the ecology and maintenance of the Stx-encoding prophage of E. coli O157:H7 and may well contribute to the evolution of the virulence of these bacteria to colonize humans.

7201661|t|In vitro adhesion of Staphylococcus strains to rabbit tissues.
7201661|a|Differences in the in vitro adhesion of Staphylococcus strains on rabbit tissues were evaluated by viable unit counts and radio-labeling. Among coagulase-positive strains, two freshly isolated strains and the Cowan I strain adhered much more than the Wood 46 strain especially to peritoneum. In addition, the Smith strain, which is coagulase-positive and encapsulated, showed on rabbit peritoneum a degree of adhesion smaller than that of the Cowan I strain and similar to that of the Wood 46 strain. These quantitative results were corroborated by examination of the bacteria on thin sections of peritoneum or on whole mesentery samples with fluorescence microscopy. With fluorochroming either with acridine orange or fluorescent homologous antibodies, we could detect a preferential localization of the bacteria on the epithelium and also on fibers of the mesentery. Even if the Cowan I strain produces Protein A, this substance does not seem to have been involved in the adhesion of this strain to rabbit tissues, since IgG did not affect the degree of its adhesion. Treatment by Na metaperiodate of the peritoneum had an inhibitory effect of about 50% on the degree of adhesion; several other known inhibitors had no effect. The higher affinity of the Cowan I strain for the peritoneum or the mesentery, when compared with the Wood 46 strain, is an observation which could contribute to the study and understanding of adhesion, presumably an element of the experimental pathogenicity of Staphylococcus.

Biofilm formation was also seen in polystyrene 96 well plates using crystal violet, and this method was selected to measure variations in biofilms between wild type and mutant strains to investigate the effect of EPS production on biofilm formation (Figure 2). Comparison of L. johnsonii FI9785 with the well-known probiotic strain L. rhamnosus GG indicated that biofilm formation of these two strains was quite similar.

6417341|t|Mutations in the promoter regions of the malEFG and malK-lamB operons of Escherichia coli K12.
6417341|a|The malB region of Escherichia coli is composed of two operons, malEFG and malK-lamB, transcribed divergently from a control region located between the malE and malK genes. Expression of the malB operons is under the positive control of the malT gene product (MalT) and maltose and of the crp gene product (CRP) and cyclic AMP. Strains in which the lac genes have been fused to malE or malK are unable to use lactose as carbon source if they have been deleted for malT or crp. Mutations in the malB region allowing such fusion strains to grow on lactose have been isolated. These and previously isolated mutations were genetically characterized. As regards the malEp promoter mutations, malEp9, malEp1 and malEp6 create new promoters that are MalT and CRP independent. malEp9 and malEp1 change residues -1 and -2, respectively, of malEp without altering its activity. malEp6 duplicates six base-pairs between residues -22 and -23. malEp3 improves the -10 region hexamer. malEp5 deletes residues -29 to -62. It creates a new promoter that is MalT independent, CRP dependent, likely by fusing together functional regions of malEp that are normally apart. malEp5 also reduces the expression of malK-lamB, suggesting the existence of a link between the malEp and malKp promoters. As regards the malKp mutations, malKp6 changes residue -81 of malKp without altering its activity. It creates a new promoter, which is MalT independent, CRP dependent, likely by using a pre-existing cyclic AMP/CRP binding site. malKp102 changes residue -36, two bases upstream of the -35 region hexamer. It decreases the activity of malKp by at least four orders of magnitude and likely alters the MalT binding site. These results are discussed in terms of regulatory interactions within the malB control region.

19329624|t|Salinivibrio siamensis sp. nov., from fermented fish (pla-ra) in Thailand.
19329624|a|A Gram-negative, facultatively anaerobic, moderately halophilic bacterium, strain ND1-1(T), was isolated from fermented fish (pla-ra) in Thailand. The cells were curved rods, motile and non-endospore-forming. The novel strain grew optimally at 37 degrees C, at pH 8 and in the presence of 9-10 % (w/v) NaCl. The predominant respiratory lipoquinone was Q-8. The major cellular fatty acids were C(16 : 0) and C(12 : 0). Polar lipid analysis revealed the presence of phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol and diphosphatidylglycerol. The DNA G+C content was 49.0 mol%. Comparative 16S rRNA gene sequence analyses indicated that strain ND1-1(T) was closely related to Salinivibrio costicola, which comprises three subspecies, and Salinivibrio proteolyticus with gene sequence similarities of 98.3-98.6 %. Strain ND1-1(T) showed low levels of DNA-DNA relatedness with S. costicola subsp. costicola JCM 15095(T) (33.2 %), S. costicola subsp. alcaliphilus DSM 16359(T) (38.4 %), S. costicola subsp. vallismortis JCM 15096(T) (59.7 %), and S. proteolyticus AF-2004(T) (42.1 %). On the basis of the physiological and biochemical characteristics and the molecular data presented, strain ND1-1(T) should be classified as a novel species of the genus Salinivibrio for which the name Salinivibrio siamensis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is ND1-1(T) (=JCM 14472(T)=PCU 301(T)=TISTR 1810(T)).

23935486|t|Structural basis for native agonist and synthetic inhibitor recognition by the Pseudomonas aeruginosa quorum sensing regulator PqsR (MvfR).
23935486|a|Bacterial populations co-ordinate gene expression collectively through quorum sensing (QS), a cell-to-cell communication mechanism employing diffusible signal molecules. The LysR-type transcriptional regulator (LTTR) protein PqsR (MvfR) is a key component of alkyl-quinolone (AQ)-dependent QS in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. PqsR is activated by 2-alkyl-4-quinolones including the Pseudomonas quinolone signal (PQS; 2-heptyl-3-hydroxy-4(1H)-quinolone), its precursor 2-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline (HHQ) and their C9 congeners, 2-nonyl-3-hydroxy-4(1H)-quinolone (C9-PQS) and 2-nonyl-4-hydroxyquinoline (NHQ). These drive the autoinduction of AQ biosynthesis and the up-regulation of key virulence determinants as a function of bacterial population density. Consequently, PqsR constitutes a potential target for novel antibacterial agents which attenuate infection through the blockade of virulence. Here we present the crystal structures of the PqsR co-inducer binding domain (CBD) and a complex with the native agonist NHQ. We show that the structure of the PqsR CBD has an unusually large ligand-binding pocket in which a native AQ agonist is stabilized entirely by hydrophobic interactions. Through a ligand-based design strategy we synthesized and evaluated a series of 50 AQ and novel quinazolinone (QZN) analogues and measured the impact on AQ biosynthesis, virulence gene expression and biofilm development. The simple exchange of two isosteres (OH for NH₂) switches a QZN agonist to an antagonist with a concomitant impact on the induction of bacterial virulence factor production. We also determined the complex crystal structure of a QZN antagonist bound to PqsR revealing a similar orientation in the ligand binding pocket to the native agonist NHQ. This structure represents the first description of an LTTR-antagonist complex. Overall these studies present novel insights into LTTR ligand binding and ligand-based drug design and provide a chemical scaffold for further anti-P. aeruginosa virulence drug development by targeting the AQ receptor PqsR.

20609608|t|Pathogenesis of the hyperlipidemia of Gram-negative bacterial sepsis may involve pathomorphological changes in liver sinusoidal endothelial cells.
20609608|a|The Gram-negative bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa is one of the most common opportunistic pathogens, especially after liver transplantation. Pathophysiological alterations of liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) have far-reaching repercussions on the liver and on metabolism. LSECs are perforated with fenestrations, pores that facilitate the transfer of lipoproteins and macromolecules between blood and hepatocytes. Gram-negative bacterial endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide, LPS) and the P. aeruginosa toxin, pyocyanin, have marked effects on LSECs. Initial loss of LSEC porosity (defenestration) induced by P. aeruginosa pyocyanin and LPS may confer subsequent immune tolerance to circulating bacterial antigens and toxins. This review collates the known immune responses of the liver to Gram-negative bacterial toxins, with a focus on LSECs. Hyperlipidemia is an important response to Gram-negative bacterial sepsis. The mechanisms proposed for sepsis-associated hyperlipidemia include tissue lipoprotein lipase inhibition and upregulated hepatic triglyceride production. In this review, we propose defenestration of the LSECs by bacterial toxins as an additional mechanism for the hyperlipidemia of sepsis. Given the role of LSECs in hyperlipidemia and liver allograft rejection, LSEC changes induced by P. aeruginosa toxins including LPS and pyocyanin may have significant clinical implications.

Specific detection of this microorganism could be of interest to the dairy industry. We also note that Propionibacterium freudenreichii was rapidly identified in Leerdamer cheese by DGGE; this microorganism is particularly difficult to cultivate on artificial medium and requires an incubation time of at least 7 days. Unexpectedly, we identified Pseudoalteromonas species and Halomonas species by sequencing two unassigned bands found in the Epoisses cheese profiles. This is the first time that these two salt-tolerant bacterial species are found in dairy products; their identification was enabled by molecular methods.

24302732|t|Structural basis of biological NO generation by octaheme oxidoreductases.
24302732|a|Nitric oxide is an important molecule in all domains of life with significant biological functions in both pro- and eukaryotes. Anaerobic ammonium-oxidizing (anammox) bacteria that contribute substantially to the release of fixed nitrogen into the atmosphere use the oxidizing power of NO to activate inert ammonium into hydrazine (N2H4). Here, we describe an enzyme from the anammox bacterium Kuenenia stuttgartiensis that uses a novel pathway to make NO from hydroxylamine. This new enzyme is related to octaheme hydroxylamine oxidoreductase, a key protein in aerobic ammonium-oxidizing bacteria. By a multiphasic approach including the determination of the crystal structure of the K. stuttgartiensis enzyme at 1.8 Å resolution and refinement and reassessment of the hydroxylamine oxidoreductase structure from Nitrosomonas europaea, both in the presence and absence of their substrates, we propose a model for NO formation by the K. stuttgartiensis enzyme. Our results expand the understanding of the functions that the widespread family of octaheme proteins have.

22662140|t|Genome-wide study of the defective sucrose fermenter strain of Vibrio cholerae from the Latin American cholera epidemic.
22662140|a|The 7th cholera pandemic reached Latin America in 1991, spreading from Peru to virtually all Latin American countries. During the late epidemic period, a strain that failed to ferment sucrose dominated cholera outbreaks in the Northern Brazilian Amazon region. In order to understand the genomic characteristics and the determinants of this altered sucrose fermenting phenotype, the genome of the strain IEC224 was sequenced. This paper reports a broad genomic study of this strain, showing its correlation with the major epidemic lineage. The potentially mobile genomic regions are shown to possess GC content deviation, and harbor the main V. cholera virulence genes. A novel bioinformatic approach was applied in order to identify the putative functions of hypothetical proteins, and was compared with the automatic annotation by RAST. The genome of a large bacteriophage was found to be integrated to the IEC224's alanine aminopeptidase gene. The presence of this phage is shown to be a common characteristic of the El Tor strains from the Latin American epidemic, as well as its putative ancestor from Angola. The defective sucrose fermenting phenotype is shown to be due to a single nucleotide insertion in the V. cholerae sucrose-specific transportation gene. This frame-shift mutation truncated a membrane protein, altering its structural pore-like conformation. Further, the identification of a common bacteriophage reinforces both the monophyletic and African-Origin hypotheses for the main causative agent of the 1991 Latin America cholera epidemics.

24794620-016|a|We found the filamentous fungus Scopulariopsis brevicaulis (OTU 1) and the yeasts Pyxidiophora arvernensis (OTU 2), Debaryomyces hansenii (OTU 3) and Nectria mariannaeae (OTU 4) to be the most abundant fungi in the cheese rind samples analyzed. This finding is consistent with recent results on the surfaces of Danish cheeses, where Debaryomyces hansenii and Scopulariopsis brevicaulis were found to be abundant ( Gori et al., 2013). The occurrence of S. brevicaulis in raw milk and cheese has been confirmed by other recent studies ( Lavoie et al., 2012 and Ropars et al., 2012) and Debaryomyces hansenii has been found on Fontina and various Austrian cheeses ( Dolci et al., 2009, Dolci et al., 2013, Lopandic et al., 2006 and Prillinger et al., 1999). We also observed Pyxidiophora- and Nectria-like OTUs that have not been previously described in cheese, although Nectria has been isolated from raw cow's milk ( Lavoie et al., 2012).

18809652|t|Alterations in Helicobacter pylori outer membrane and outer membrane vesicle-associated lipopolysaccharides under iron-limiting growth conditions.
18809652|a|Outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) shed from the gastroduodenal pathogen Helicobacter pylori have measurable effects on epithelial cell responses. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of iron availability, and its basis, on the extent and nature of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) produced on H. pylori OMVs and their parental bacterial cells. Electrophoretic, immunoblotting and structural analyses revealed that LPSs of bacterial cells grown under iron-limited conditions were notably shorter than those of bacteria and OMVs obtained from iron-replete conditions. Structural analysis and serological probing showed that LPSs of iron-replete cells and OMVs expressed O-chains of Lewis(x) with a terminal Lewis(y) unit, whereas Lewis(y) expression was notably reduced on bacteria and OMVs from iron-limiting conditions. Unlike the O-chain, the core oligosaccharide and lipid A moieties of iron-replete and iron-limited bacteria and their OMVs were similar. Quantitatively, shed OMVs from iron-replete bacteria were found to be LPSenriched, whereas shed OMVs from iron-limited bacteria had a significantly reduced content of LPS. These differences were linked to bacterial ATP levels. Since iron availability affects the extent and nature of LPS expressed by H. pylori, host iron status may contribute to H. pylori pathogenesis.

10941782|a|Marine invertebrates are sources of a diverse array of bioactive metabolites with great potential for development as drugs and research tools. In many cases, microorganisms are known or suspected to be the biosynthetic source of marine invertebrate natural products. The application of molecular microbiology to the study of these relationships will contribute to basic biological knowledge and facilitate biotechnological development of these valuable resources. The bryostatin-producing bryozoan B. neritina and its specific symbiont "Candidatus Endobugula sertula" constitute one promising model system. Another fertile subject for investigation is the listhistid sponges that contain numerous bioactive metabolites, some of which originate from bacterial symbionts.

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to summarize global estimates of the epidemiology, clinical characteristics, and outcomes of this zoonosis. We searched main literature databases for all studies through December 2012 using the search term "streptococcus suis." The prevalence of S. suis infection is highest in Asia; the primary risk factors are occupational exposure and eating of contaminated food. The pooled proportions of case-patients with pig-related occupations and history of eating high-risk food were 38.1% and 37.3%, respectively. The main clinical syndrome was meningitis (pooled rate 68.0%), followed by sepsis, arthritis, endocarditis, and endophthalmitis. The pooled case-fatality rate was 12.8%. Sequelae included hearing loss (39.1%) and vestibular dysfunction (22.7%). Our analysis identified gaps in the literature, particularly in assessing risk factors and sequelae of this infection.

24722168|a|This study aims to establish a human gut microbiota (HGM) transplanted gnotobiotic (Gn) pig model of human rotavirus (HRV) infection and diarrhea, and to verify the dose-effects of probiotics on HRV vaccine-induced immune responses. Our previous studies using the Gn pig model found that probiotics dose-dependently regulated both T cell and B cell immune responses induced by rotavirus vaccines. We generated the HGM transplanted neonatal Gn pigs through daily feeding of neonatal human fecal suspension to germ-free pigs for 3 days starting at 12 hours after birth. We found that attenuated HRV (AttHRV) vaccination conferred similar overall protection against rotavirus diarrhea and virus shedding in Gn pigs and HGM transplanted Gn pigs. HGM promoted the development of the neonatal immune system, as evidenced by the significantly enhanced IFN-γ producing T cell responses and reduction of regulatory T cells and their cytokine production in the AttHRV-vaccinated pigs. The higher dose Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) feeding (14 doses, up to 109 colony-forming-unit [CFU]/dose) effectively increased the LGG counts in the HGM Gn pig intestinal contents and significantly enhanced HRV-specific IFN-γ producing T cell responses to the AttHRV vaccine. Lower dose LGG (9 doses, up to 106 CFU/dose) was ineffective. Neither doses of LGG significantly improved the protection rate, HRV-specific IgA and IgG antibody titers in serum, or IgA antibody titers in intestinal contents compared to the AttHRV vaccine alone, suggesting that an even higher dose of LGG is needed to overcome the influence of the microbiota to achieve the immunostimulatory effect in the HGM pigs. This study demonstrated that HGM Gn pig is an applicable animal model for studying immune responses to rotavirus vaccines and can be used for studying interventions (i.e., probiotics and prebiotics) that may enhance the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of vaccines through improving the gut microbiota.

21557059|t|Adhesion by pathogenic corynebacteria.
21557059|a|Pathogenic members of the genus Corynebacterium cause a wide range of serious infections in humans including diphtheria. Adhesion to host cells is a crucial step during infection. In Corynebacterium diphtheriae, adhesion is mediated primarily by filamentous structures called pili or fimbriae that are covalently attached to the bacterial cell wall. C. diphtheriae produces three distinct pilus structures, SpaA-, SpaD- and SpaH-type pili. Similar to other types, the prototype SpaA pilus consists of SpaA forming the pilus shaft and two minor pilins SpaB and SpaC located at the base and at the tip, respectively. The minor pilins SpaB/SpaC are critical for bacterial binding to human pharyngeal cells, and thus represent the major adhesins of corynebacteria. Like pili of many other gram-positive microbes, the assembly of corynebacterial pili occurs by a two-step mechanism, whereby pilins are covalently polymerized by a transpeptidase enzyme named pilin-specific sortase and the generated pilus polymer is subsequently anchored to the cell wall peptidoglycan via the base pilin by the housekeeping sortase or a non-polymerizing sortase. This chapter reviews the current knowledge of corynebacterial adhesion, with a specific focus on pilus structures, their assembly, and the mechanism of adhesion mediated by pili.

24621108|a|The incorporation of essential oils and nanotechnology into edible films has the potential to improve the microbiological safety of foods. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of pullulan films containing essential oils and nanoparticles against 4 foodborne pathogens. Initial experiments using plate overlay assays demonstrated that 2% oregano essential oil was active against Staphylococcus aureus and Salmonella Typhimurium, whereas Listeria monocytogenes and Escherichia coli O157:H7 were not inhibited. Two percent rosemary essential oil was active against S. aureus, L. monocytogenes, E. coli O157:H7, and S. Typhimurium, when compared with 1%. Zinc oxide nanoparticles at 110 nm were active against S. aureus, L. monocytogenes, E. coli O157:H7, and S. Typhimurium, when compared with 100 or 130 nm. Conversely, 100 nm silver (Ag) nanoparticles were more active against S. aureus than L. monocytogenes. Using the results from these experiments, the compounds exhibiting the greatest activity were incorporated into pullulan films and found to inhibit all or some of the 4 pathogens in plate overlay assays. In challenge studies, pullulan films containing the compounds effectively inhibited the pathogens associated with vacuum packaged meat and poultry products stored at 4 °C for up to 3 wk, as compared to control films. Additionally, the structure and cross-section of the films were evaluated using electron microscopy. The results from this study demonstrate that edible films made from pullulan and incorporated with essential oils or nanoparticles may improve the safety of refrigerated, fresh or further processed meat and poultry products.

19126546|t|Structural and functional analysis of the C-terminal DNA binding domain of the Salmonella typhimurium SPI-2 response regulator SsrB.
19126546|a|In bacterial pathogenesis, virulence gene regulation is controlled by two-component regulatory systems. In Escherichia coli, the EnvZ/OmpR two-component system is best understood as regulating expression of outer membrane proteins, but in Salmonella enterica, OmpR activates transcription of the SsrA/B two-component system located on Salmonella pathogenicity island 2 (SPI-2). The response regulator SsrB controls expression of a type III secretory system in which effectors modify the vacuolar membrane and prevent its degradation via the endocytic pathway. Vacuolar modification enables Salmonella to survive and replicate in the macrophage phagosome and disseminate to the liver and spleen to cause systemic infection. The signals that activate EnvZ and SsrA are unknown but are related to the acidic pH encountered in the vacuole. Our previous work established that SsrB binds to regions of DNA that are AT-rich, with poor sequence conservation. Although SsrB is a major virulence regulator in Salmonella, very little is known regarding how it binds DNA and activates transcription. In the present work, we solved the structure of the C-terminal DNA binding domain of SsrB (SsrB(C)) by NMR and analyzed the effect of amino acid substitutions on function. We identified residues in the DNA recognition helix (Lys(179), Met(186)) and the dimerization interface (Val(197), Leu(201)) that are important for SsrB transcriptional activation and DNA binding. An essential cysteine residue in the N-terminal receiver domain was also identified (Cys(45)), and the effect of Cys(203) on dimerization was evaluated. Our results suggest that although disulfide bond formation is not required for dimerization, dimerization occurs upon DNA binding and is required for subsequent activation of transcription. Disruption of the dimer interface by a C203E substitution reduces SsrB activity. Modification of Cys(203) or Cys(45) may be an important mode of SsrB inactivation inside the host.

25648083-000|a|Lactobacillus johnsonii FI9785 is a potential competitive exclusion agent to control Clostridium perfringens and other pathogens in poultry [4]. However, the mode of action related to this protective effect is as yet undefined. The adherence capacity of probiotic bacteria to the GI tract is a contributing factor for pathogen exclusion [5] and the cell surface characteristics of probiotic bacteria have been related to these adhesion properties [6-9]. Several members of the genus Lactobacillus are capable of producing exopolysaccharides (EPS) which can play an essential role in determining the cell surface characteristics [7]. EPS are also involved in the formation of biofilms [10,11], which may improve colonisation and aid survival [12-14].

24837294|t|Modification of Streptococcus mutans Cnm by PgfS contributes to adhesion, endothelial cell invasion, and virulence.
24837294|a|Expression of the surface protein Cnm has been directly implicated in the ability of certain strains of Streptococcus mutans to bind to collagen and to invade human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAEC) and in the killing of Galleria mellonella. Sequencing analysis of Cnm(+) strains revealed that cnm is located between the core genes SMU.2067 and SMU.2069. Reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) analysis showed that cnm is cotranscribed with SMU.2067, encoding a putative glycosyltransferase referred to here as PgfS (protein glycosyltransferase of streptococci). Notably, Cnm contains a threonine-rich domain predicted to undergo O-linked glycosylation. The previously shown abnormal migration pattern of Cnm, the presence of the threonine-rich domain, and the molecular linkage of cnm with pgfS lead us to hypothesize that PgfS modifies Cnm. A ΔpgfS strain showed defects in several traits associated with Cnm expression, including collagen binding, HCAEC invasion, and killing of G. mellonella. Western blot analysis revealed that Cnm from the ΔpgfS mutant migrated at a lower molecular weight than that from the parent strain. In addition, Cnm produced by ΔpgfS was highly susceptible to proteinase K degradation, in contrast to the high-molecular-weight Cnm version found in the parent strain. Lectin-binding analyses confirmed the glycosylated nature of Cnm and strongly suggested the presence of N-acetylglucosamine residues attached to Cnm. Based on these findings, the phenotypes observed in ΔpgfS are most likely associated with defects in Cnm glycosylation that affects protein function, stability, or both. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that Cnm is a glycoprotein and that posttranslational modification mediated by PgfS contributes to the virulence-associated phenotypes linked to Cnm.

10639454|t|Lack of a role of cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1 toxin from Escherichia coli in bacterial pathogenicity and host cytokine response in infected germfree piglets.
10639454|a|Some Escherichia coli strains isolated from intestinal or extraintestinal infections in pigs produce cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1 (CNF1). In order to analyze the role of CNF1 in the pathogenesis of porcine colibacillosis, newborn colostrum-deprived germfree piglets were orally inoculated with a wild-type CNF1-producing strain (M623) or with an isogenic cnf1 mutant (M623DeltaCNF1). The two isogenic strains induced a high mortality with similar lung and serosal inflammatory lesions, indicating that both strains were pathogenic in these piglets. Bacterial counts in various organs of inoculated piglets revealed an intestinal predisposition of M623 and M623DeltaCNF1 strains for the cecum and colon. Extraintestinal organs (lungs, liver, spleen, and kidney) were also colonized by both strains. Similar colonization of intestinal and extraintestinal tissues in animals inoculated with either strain was observed, except in the ileum, where M623 showed a higher colonization than M623DeltaCNF1. Intestinal (ileum and colon), extraintestinal (lung and kidney), and immune (mesenteric lymph nodes and spleen) tissues were sampled at 1 day postinoculation and analyzed for cytokine expression by a reverse transcriptase PCR technique. Inoculation with E. coli M623 induced an enhanced expression of inflammatory cytokines (interleukin-1alpha [IL-1alpha], tumor necrosis factor alpha, and IL-12p40) in the intestinal organs compared to uninoculated piglets or piglets inoculated with nonpathogenic intestinal E. coli 862B, which is also able to colonize the intestinal tract. There was little difference in cytokine transcript levels in the intestinal and extraintestinal organs in piglets inoculated with E. coli strains M623 or M623DeltaCNF1, except in the ileum, where IL-1alpha and IL-8 mRNA levels correlated with bacterial colonization. Expression of regulatory cytokines (gamma interferon and IL-4) was weak in immune tissues from piglets inoculated with M623 or M623DeltaCNF1. Taken together, our data indicate that the CNF1-producing strain, M623, is pathogenic and induces inflammatory cytokine expression in germfree, colostrum-deprived piglets. Nevertheless, in this model, the CNF1 toxin does not appear to be a major factor for pathogenicity or cytokine response, as demonstrated by the use of an isogenic cnf1 mutant.

25880122-001|a|Laboratory experiments indicated that P. damnosus LMG 28219 produces EPS. The ability of a strain to produce EPS is not directly correlated to its ability to reside in beer but probably has importance in biofilm formation [12], thereby enabling persistence in the brewery environment. The EPS produced by P. claussenii ATCC BAA-344T is a high-molecular-mass β-glucan produced by the action of a transmembrane glycosyl transferase (gtf) gene. This gene is located on plasmid pPECL-7, which is not essential for growth in beer [21]. The fibrillar polymer consists of a trisaccharide repeating unit with a β-1,3-linked glucose backbone and branches made up of single β-1,2-linked D-glucopyranosyl residues. Walling and colleagues [33] reported a glucosyl transferase gene (dps) in P. damnosus IOEB8801, originating from wine, that produces a linear backbone of 3-β-D-glucose-1 moieties.

Outcomes of emergency colectomy for fulminant Clostridium difficile colitis.
Clostridium difficile has become increasingly a common cause of nosocomial infection with increasing antibiotic usage. Recently there has been an increase in the incidence of patients undergoing colectomy for fulminant C. difficile colitis (FCDC). Early surgical consultation is necessary to avoid delay in diagnosis. We present a retrospective review of the outcomes of colectomies for FCDC at our large district general hospital.

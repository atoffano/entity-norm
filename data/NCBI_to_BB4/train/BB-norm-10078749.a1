T1	Title 0 68	GCH1 mutation in a patient with adult-onset oromandibular dystonia.
T2	Paragraph 68 418	The authors report a mutation in exon 5 of GCH1 in a patient with adult-onset oromandibular dystonia and no obvious family history of dystonia. The patient responded positively to treatment with L-dopa. These findings demonstrate that GCH1 mutations must be considered even in patients with dystonic symptoms not typical of dopa-responsive dystonia.

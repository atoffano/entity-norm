T2	Paragraph 102 557	A total of 362 males from various regions of Papua New Guinea were screened for red cell glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) activity. Twenty-six G6PD deficient individuals were identified. Biochemical characterization of G6PD purified from these subjects has revealed 13 new variants and several copies of previously described forms of G6PD. This study illustrates the extreme heterogeneity of G6PD deficiency among the people of Papua New Guinea..

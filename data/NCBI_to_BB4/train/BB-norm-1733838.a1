T1	Title 0 78	Localisation of the gene for Norrie disease to between DXS7 and DXS426 on Xp.
T2	Paragraph 78 558	A highly informative microsatellite marker, DXS426, which maps proximal to DXS7 in the interval Xp11. 4-Xp11 4-Xp11. 23, has been used to refine further the localisation of the gene for Norrie disease (NDP). The results from a multiply informative crossover localize the NDP gene proximal to DXS7. In conjunction with information from 2 NDP patients who have a deletion for DXS7 but not for DSX426, our data indicate that the NDP gene lies between DXS7 and DXS426 on proximal Xp.

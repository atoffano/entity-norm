T1	Title 0 42	A new CT pattern in adrenoleukodystrophy.
T2	Paragraph 42 766	A new CT pattern was observed in 2 patients with adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD). This pattern, which the authors call Type II, is characterized by the absence of posterior periventricular areas of decreased attenuation around the trigone on non-contrast scans  after contrast infusion, however, there is striking enhancement of various white-matter structures (tracts or fiber systems) such as the internal capsules, corpus callosum, corona radiata, forceps major, and cerebral peduncles. This is different from numerous previous descriptions of the CT pattern in ALD. Type II ALD does not appear to have been seen in any other leukoencephalopathy and is probably specific for a phenotypic variant or an evolving stage of ALD..

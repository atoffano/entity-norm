T1	Title 0 144	Detection of a new submicroscopic Norrie disease deletion interval with a novel DNA probe isolated by differential Alu PCR fingerprint cloning.
T2	Paragraph 144 879	Differential Alu PCR fingerprint cloning was used to isolate a DNA probe from the Xp11. 4-- > p11. 21 region of the human X chromosome. This novel sequence, cpXr318 (DXS742), detects a new submicroscopic deletion interval at the Norrie disease locus (NDP). Combining our data with the consensus genetic map of the proximal short arm of the X chromosome, we propose the physical order Xcen-DXS14-DXS255- (DXS426, TIMP) - (DXS742- ([MAOB-MAOA-DXS7], NDP) -DXS77-DXS228) -DXS209-DXS148-DXS196- + + + Xpter. The cpXr318 probe and a subclone from a cosmid corresponding to the DXS7 locus were converted into sequence-tagged sites. Finally, DXS742, DSX7, DXS77, and MAOA were integrated into a physical map spanning the Norrie disease locus

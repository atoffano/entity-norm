T2	Paragraph 67 924	Chromosomal studies were performed on peripheral blood lymphocytes and cultured skin fibroblasts from five Israeli-Moroccan families with ataxia-telangiectasia. A total of 24 individuals, including seven propositi, was investigated. Among the probands, significantly elevated rates of chromosome damage were observed in both blood and skin. Skin fibroblasts of affected individuals showed several orders of magnitude more chromosome breakage than lymphocytes. Increased rates of chromosome damage were also observed in the fibroblasts of some phenotypically normal family members (obligate heterozygotes and sibs) when compared to normal controls. An apparent abnormal clone of cells, possessing a large acrocentric marker chromosome (14q +), was observed in varying proportions among cells of all the propositi (2-5% of lymphocytes; 1-9% of fibroblasts)..

T1	Title 0 108	A mutation in autosomal dominant myotonia congenita affects pore properties of the muscle chloride channel.
T2	Paragraph 108 1468	Autosomal dominant myotonia congenita is an inherited disorder of skeletal muscle caused by mutations in a voltage-gated Cl- channel gene (CLCN1, 7q35). Here, we report that a mutation predicting the substitution of Gly 230 by glutamic acid (G230E) between segments D3 and D4 dramatically alters the pore properties of a recombinant human muscle Cl- channel (hCIC-1) expressed in a mammalian cell line (tsA201). The G230E mutation causes substantial changes in anion and cation selectivity as well as a fundamental change in rectification of the current-voltage relationship. Whereas wild-type channels are characterized by pronounced inward rectification and a Cl > thiocyanate > Br > NO (3) > I > CH (3) SO (3) selectivity, G230E exhibits outward rectification at positive potentials and a thiocyanate > NO (3) > I > Br > Cl > CH (3) SO (3) selectivity. Furthermore, the cation-to-anion permeability ratio of the mutant is much greater than that of the wild-type channel. Voltage-dependent blocks by intracellular and extracellular iodide help to distinguish two distinct ion binding sites within the hClC-1 conduction pathway. Both binding sites are preserved in the mutant but have decreased affinities for iodide. These findings suggest that Gly 230 is critical for normal ion conductance in hClC-1 and that this residue resides within the channel pore..

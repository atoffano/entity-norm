T2	Paragraph 124 1620	A novel C to A mutation in the sterol 27-hydroxylase gene (CYP27) was identified by sequencing amplified CYP27 gene products from a patient with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX). The mutation changed the adrenodoxin cofactor binding residue 362Arg to 362Ser (CGT 362Arg to AGT 362Ser), and was responsible for deficiency in the sterol 27-hydroxylase activity, as confirmed by expression of mutant cDNA into COS-1 cells. Quantitative analysis showed that the expression of CYP27 gene mRNA in the patient represented 52. 5% of the normal level. As the mutation occurred at the penultimate nucleotide of exon 6 (-2 position of exon 6-intron 6 splice site) of the gene, we hypothesized that the mutation may partially affect the normal splicing efficiency in exon 6 and cause alternative splicing elsewhere, which resulted in decreased transcript in the patient. Transfection of constructed minigenes, with or without the mutation, into COS-1 cells confirmed that the mutant minigene was responsible for a mRNA species alternatively spliced at an activated cryptic 5 splice site 88 bp upstream from the 3 end of exon 6. Our data suggest that the C to A mutation at the penultimate nucleotide of exon 6 of the CYP27 gene not only causes the deficiency in the sterol 27-hydroxylase activity, but also partially leads to alternative pre-mRNA splicing of the gene. To our knowledge, this is the first report regarding effects on pre-mRNA splicing of a mutation at the -2 position of a 5 splice site.
